Collateral Update for Lunarium Coin (XLN)
The Lunarium Coin (XLN) Project continues its journey to provide a secure, efficient, and sustainable solution in the world of cryptocurrencies. In order to ensure the longevity and stability of the network, we are implementing an important change in the reward system and the coin issuance model. This document outlines these changes and the expected impact on the community.

Changes to Collateral and Block Reward
Starting from block number 621701, the reward issuance will operate with the following parameters:

Block Reward
The block reward will be adjusted to 10 XLN coins starting from block 621701. This reward will be distributed as follows:

95% to Masternodes (MN): Aimed at incentivizing Masternode operators, who are essential for security and fast transaction processing on the network.
5% to Proof of Stake (POS): Maintaining active participation from XLN holders, promoting decentralization and participation in network validation.
Fixed Collateral
From this block onwards, the collateral required for operation will be fixed at 1,000,000 XLN, which will remain constant during all subsequent halvings. This contributes to the stability and predictability of the model.

This redistribution has been designed based on technical and economic analyses to meet the network's needs while enhancing security and system stability.

Halving Projection: Scarcity and Sustainability
As part of the long-term plan, Lunarium Coin will follow a decreasing issuance schedule, with three halvings every four years forecasted. This model reduces rewards at regular intervals, ensuring that new coin issuance becomes progressively scarcer until a fixed issuance state is reached at the final halving.

Benefits of Halving
Avoid Inflation: The gradual reduction in coin issuance mitigates the risk of exceeding the circulating supply, helping to preserve the value of XLN over time.
Stabilize Prices: With controlled and predictable issuance, it is expected that market volatility will decrease, attracting investors and increasing confidence in the coin.
Strengthen the Network: The programmed scarcity encourages long-term participation and promotes a more robust infrastructure.

Reward Schedule (Projection every 4 years)

Year (Starting Block)	Starting Block	Block Reward (XLN)	Daily Issuance (XLN)	Annual Issuance (XLN)	Emission Reduction (%)

1st Cycle	621701	10	14,400	5,256,000	-

2nd Cycle (Halving 1)	2,724,101	5	7,200	2,628,000	50%

3rd Cycle (Halving 2)	4,826,501	2	2,880	1,051,200	80%

4th Cycle (Halving 3)	6,928,901	1	1,440	525,600	Fixed Emission

Note: Each cycle is approximately 2,102,400 blocks, corresponding to 4 years with an average of 1440 blocks per day.

Important
From the 4th Cycle (Halving 3), the reward will be 1 XLN per block and will remain at this value until the infinite block, creating a fixed issuance model.

Benefits for the Community
The proposed changes not only enhance network security but also strengthen Lunarium Coin's commitment to becoming a reliable and valuable cryptocurrency in the market. Below are the main benefits for the community:

1. Masternode Operators
The reward redistribution, with higher participation for masternodes, encourages more operators to contribute to the network, ensuring greater security and efficiency in transaction validation.

2. XLN Holders
With scheduled scarcity and controlled issuance, the expectation is that the value of existing coins will increase over time, providing an incentive for holders to retain their coins.

3. Long-Term Sustainability
Controlled issuance offers predictability and support for the XLN ecosystem, making it an attractive option for investors and blockchain enthusiasts seeking a more robust and sustainable cryptocurrency.

Conclusion
The update to the reward system and issuance of Lunarium Coin marks a significant step in the network's evolution. With the implementation of the halving model and the redistribution of rewards, the project aims not only to protect the network from inflation but also to create a more secure and sustainable ecosystem.

We invite the entire community to actively participate in this historic moment and continue contributing to the growth of Lunarium Coin (XLN).
